Python mmmm, hello new friend. 


I had a go at building a simple Neural Network using the following resources: 

[How to build a simple neural network in 9 lines of Python code](https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1#.nrvzh5cip)
[A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/)


Mine is neither 9 or 11 lines.. it's more like 30 something but I understand it better like so.
